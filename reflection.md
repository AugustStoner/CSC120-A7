Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

In the Cafe class, I overloaded the sellCoffee() and restock() methods to have versions where input is not needed, and the class uses default values to make interaction simpler. 
In the House class, I overloaded 2 versions of the constructor, so there is a default version with name, address, and nFloors; another version that adds a hasDiningRoom attribute; and another version that adds hasDiningRoom and hasElevator attributes. I wanted to create a simpler way to make new Houses that don't have a dining hall or elevator, and the default constructor uses a value of false unless specified otherwise. 
In the Library class, I overloaded the constructor to have a version that does not require an nFloors input. I also overloaded the printCollection() method, creating a version that uses a Boolean "available" value, so it will print all available books for an input of "true" and all checked out books for an input of "false". 

This assignment went well overall, the methods provided in Building made overriding and overloading methods much more straightforward than it would have been to figure out those methods from scratch. For someone taking this course in the future, I would say that getting a basic understanding of an assignment early on is extremely useful to begin working through problems and brainstorming, and getting something down on paper to begin the creative/problem-solving process is a great way to start.
